These config files are used by the AMC Driveware software to configure the motor control boards for the robot's motors.

NOTE:
The configurations for the motor controllers are specific to each motor contoller (ex. left motor must use the _Lside configs). We defined the side of the robot with all the boards and wires to be the front; left and right are then defined facing from the rear of the robot towards the front (using port and starboard convention). The control board and wires for the left side are marked with red tape and the right side are marked with green tape.

PWM Input Configuration:
The JW_PWMgood_Lside and JW_PWMgood_Rside are the current configurations loaded on the controller boards; these configurations allow the motors to be controlled by PWM signals from the Arduino controller. For the specifics of what signals to send from the Arduino, see "How to communicate with the motor controllers.txt".

Analog Input Configuration:
The JW_Analoggood_Lside and JW_Analoggood_Rside are (reconstructions of) the original configurations on the boards; these configurations allow the robot to be controlled by the attached handheld controller (when it is plugged back in). This is the way the robot was initially controlled when we were given it and ideally this method of control will either cease to exist or become easily removable and reattachable as necessary.

Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here:
Hopefully these configurations will not have to be modified in any way, but if it is necessary to modify them then ensure that the original configuration files are not modified and that each motor gets its own configuration CREATED FROM A PREVIOUS CONFIGURATION FOR THAT MOTOR. There is calibration information stored in each motor config and if the configuration from the wrong motor is loaded then the motor will NOT act predictably. Do not invoke the suffering we have already endured and make as few changes as possible to the configurations and ALWAYS maintain unchanged backups of config files.
